Design Ideas

  Players represent members of a cartel trying to setup the the big score and win the favor of the boss, 
but amongst their assiocates one or more players may be a undercover DEA agent, a FBI agent, or even a 
rival cartel trying to move in on the cartels territory.

Maybe one player plays the Boss.

Win conditions:
  Cartel members: 
    Setup and successfully close the BIG deal with the Boss in attendence.
  Rival Cartel member:
    Attend the BIG deal and successfully assasinate the Boss.
  Law Enforcement member: 
    Attend the BIG deal and successfully apprehend the Boss along with enough 
    evidence to convict the Boss for your agency. Law Enforcement Agencies do not work well together.
    
Basic gameplay ideas
    
    Players take turns arranging small meetings with potential suppliers to build relationships and notarity within the cartel 
    that lead to the BIG meeting (which exposes the Boss) and gather evidence, depending on your objectives.
    
    Meetings have events happen and that require attending players to resolve based on skills or resources brought to the meeting.
    
    Meetings have a point value. Lower point value meetings require less resources and skill to complete.
    
    Events can also have a point value to modify a meetings point value. "What started as a simple introduction meeting went 
    south quickly and ended in a Jon Woo faceoff. Trouble was averted this time, just barely."
    
    
Game Characters:
  Every character in the game is unique, the varoius roles in the game are not tied to any specific character as to allow for
  replay ability and DUH!!! a hidden adjenda.
